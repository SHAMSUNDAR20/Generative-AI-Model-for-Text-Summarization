# Generative AI Model for Text Summarization

## Description
This project implements a generative AI model for text summarization using LLMs like BART and GPT-3. Both extractive and abstractive summarization are supported.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Flask

## Features
- Pre-trained models for efficient summarization.
- Fine-tuned for both extractive and abstractive tasks.
- Flask integration for real-time text summarization.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python summarization.py
